# Gmail Scripts

To use these scripts, simply copy the code, go to [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/), paste the code in a new project, and run while accepting any permissions if prompted.

For the email filter, you may find it useful to set it to run on a recurring basis every minute.
